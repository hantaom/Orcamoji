### Git
The default branch will be set to 'dev', thus all work will be merged to here.
To start working on an issue,
1. Head over to `dev` branch

   `git checkout dev` 

2. After you did work, commit your changes. It's good practice to commit often and describe what you did in each commit

   * `git add .`  
   * `git commit -m 'added user model`  
   
4. Commits only apply locally until you push it to your branch
   
   `git push` or  
   `git push origin dev`
